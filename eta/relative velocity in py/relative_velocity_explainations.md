## Relative Velocity Explanations

>Relative velocity:  the amount of vehicles minus one, then multiply by the average 
velocity, then add the current velocity, finally the sum divided by the amount of vehicle.

>Different from reading data from json file the last semester, this time I directly read time data from the 
https://shuttles.rpi.edu/history and 
https://shuttles.rpi.edu/updates, which makes the estimated calculations more precise. When calculating with the average 
velocity based on the historical data, there are two choices for calculating average velocity: 1. Average velocity 
for all the data records in the history endpoint. 2. First find average velocities for each shuttle, then find the average 
velocity of these 11 shuttle. I think the second one is better, since later we may need the individual data for each shuttle.
