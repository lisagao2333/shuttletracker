- https://shuttles.rpi.edu/history Endpoint for the data of all the shuttles in the past 30 days. There are 11 dictionaries, which represent 11 shuttles. Since this endpoint will keep change, though slow, we should read it from the web address. However, since this json file is too large, (more than 700 MB), I decide to download it as local file, and read from local. I set to renew this local file every 30 days.
