## History data analysis plan

>For analysis history data, at first I just simplely add them up and find the average without sorting and analysis, since there are so many data for a single shuttle. 
I should have sort the data step by step, since the speed for each shuttle are very different from others.

The last 2 shuttles are much more faster than others; and the speed of the 7th shuttle are extremely low.

There is only two data for the speed of the 7th shuttle are over 8, only 5 that over 5. 
The usage for each shuttle is different, which can do a lot of work for that.
Further Analysis is needed

>The plan for future analysis is
- Find the different speeds for each shuttle on different routes and differnt time periods. And I may abandon the 7th shuttle's data, since it is almost not in use, or the data collection tool on this shuttle is broken.
